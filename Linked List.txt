Linked list is a special data structure in which data elements are linked to one another. Here, each element is called a node which has two parts

Info part which stores the information.
Address or pointer part which holds the address of next element of same type. Linked list is also known as self-referential structure.
Each element (node) of a list is comprising of two items: the data and a reference to the next node.
The last node has a reference to NULL.
The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate
node, but the reference to the first node.
If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.
typedef struct linkedlistnode
{
int data; //info
struct linkedlistnode * next;
}node;
 
Syntax of declaring a node which contains two fields in it one is for storing information and another is for storing address of other node, so that one can traverse the list.
